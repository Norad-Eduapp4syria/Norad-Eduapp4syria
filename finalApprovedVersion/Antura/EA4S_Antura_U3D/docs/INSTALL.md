# Fetch the Project

1. Get Unity latest stable (Win or Mac, v 5.5.0) from http://unity3d.com/get-unity/update

2. Download the project. There are two ways:
  1.  the **simple** is to download the zipped package (from Clone or Download green button)
  2. the **advanced** is to use a Git client to track the changes and update the project as it gets developed
    * Install a free GitHub client (https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ is good for developers, https://desktop.github.com/ is a simpler one for anybody)
    * fetch the project from this repository https://github.com/vgwb/EA4S_Antura_U3D (you can read https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/ for some help using GitHub Desktop)

3. Install the required external plugins (TextMeshPro)

4. **Play**. Once you have the EA4S_Antura_U3D folder in your computer, open it in Unity, open scene ```_app/_Start``` and press Play ;)

## Editor Setup
set the Build Setup to iOS or Android platform.

then set the Game window to **16:9** (under iOS there is a preset called iPhone 5 Wide (16:9))
